# DartScorer (Application Name is Susceptible to Change)
The goal for this project is to create an application for score keeping in the game of darts.  From simple subtracting in the games of 301, 501 and 701, to more abstract games such as Knockout.  

The Main Objective is to make it easy to keep track of dart scores when players do not have an automatic-score-keeping dart board.  Using a whiteboard, calculator, or simply a piece of paper suffices as a way to keep track but may take time.  We want to make it easy on the players so they can stay focused and in the zone while trying to defeat their opponents.

Platforms
1) Computer/Rasp Pi - Software (Not web-based)
2) Mobile - Android/iOS

A number of default games is the primary objective, with future implementations containing custom games where user can create games.

Future Ideas:
1) User Profiles
  a) Hold Statistics
  b) Filter Statistics
2)UI Upgrades
  a)Make it look pretty
